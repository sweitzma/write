# Markdown to HTML writing

Goal: simple setup that can take written markdown
and compile it to nicely styled HTML.

Okay I think this should act as a compliation interface rather than the site
itself in the future.

Potential CLI
```
spiff 
  --in-dir <markdown-dir> 
  --out-dir <html-dir>
  [--tw-style-file] <custom tailwindcss file>
  [--watch]
```
